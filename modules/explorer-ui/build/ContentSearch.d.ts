TODO:
Make another API that goes through `*.MarkdownIndex.json?summary`, and another one that goes through all file contents. (). Super direct layer on explore for files. Not per letter, per search. Does need include/exclude capability

Use the same `PathSearchResults` but augment it to show the matches in the file/summary content. Links to open the file collection.
