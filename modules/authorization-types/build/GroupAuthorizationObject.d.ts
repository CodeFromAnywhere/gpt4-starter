/**
The key, groupName, is a slug of a group, or a wildcard (*) for all groups

The value should be a concatenation of all operations permitted in this dataset.

- C for create
- R for read
- U for update
- D for delete

Example: `{ "cfa": "CRUD" }` would say that this dataset can be fully altered and read by the "cfa" group

For `Dataset`s this should be applied through the database.

For database models, this should be applied in frontmatter, like this:

```
---
authorizations: cfa:crud, public:r
---
```

The above applies on the database. For functions, you can do the following:

- X for execute
- I for reading info about the function (docs etc)
- R for reading the code (same like CRUD)
- U for updating the code (same like CRUD)

For knowledge (text), you can apply authorizations in frontmatter of the markdown, in the same way as you can for data (canRead/canWrite are the only ones needed).

NB: In a later stage we may add more permissions like "isSearchable (S)"
