The above applies on the database. For functions, you can do the following:

- X for execute
- I for reading info about the function (docs etc)
- R for reading the code (same like CRUD)
- U for updating the code (same like CRUD)

For knowledge (text), you can apply authorizations in frontmatter of the markdown, in the same way as you can for data (canRead/canWrite are the only ones needed).

NB: In a later stage we may add more permissions like "isSearchable (S)"
