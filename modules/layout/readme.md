## `<LayoutGrid />`

Style for creating a grid for the layout that is mobile friendly and has menu support



I run into this problem all the time

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71616561/css-tailwind-grid-height-100vh-not-working

final solution came from here

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47094742/fullscreen-flex-layouts-necessity-of-intermediate-flex-boxes

Unfortunately, I can't seem to hide stuff anymore for some reason on non-mobile. "lg:flex hidden" just doesn't work, just hides!

My elegant solution was to just use visible/invisible and make the mobile layout hover over the invisible one in case of a small screen, it works!

## `<SearchBar />`

Add small search bar to default header.

Ensure last search is visible in header search

Remove brave button from that small searchbar (only on big one is fine)
