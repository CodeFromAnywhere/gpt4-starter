I don't think you could find a package allowing you to convert doc files (and if you ever find one, I doubt it will have a good accuracy).

DOCX is an open file format (it's just XML : DOCX), whereas the DOC format is proprietary, so it will be way harder to get the wanted informations, if even possible.
