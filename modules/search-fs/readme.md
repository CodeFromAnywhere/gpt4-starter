  # getAllSearchResultsWithContext()

Searches filepaths, then links to any `ui-web` that has this file available as a page, or VSCode.

For this we need to get the `MarkdownReaderPage` and other pages that are available in ui's and see the files they are linked to.

I want to be able to:

- search functions, interfaces, variables
- search operations
- search markdown files, anywhere
- search db-ui models

TODO: Think about other things needed for the search, like LLM queries
