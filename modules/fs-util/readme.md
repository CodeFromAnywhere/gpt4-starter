# Fs util

fs-util (`OperationClassification` cjs)

General purpose wrapper around `node:fs` and `node:path` that should be used instead of those, because it removes some of its painpoints, removes unneeded stuff, and adds some other useful functions.




# Api reference

## ðŸ“„ path (exported const)

## ðŸ“„ fs (exported const)

NB: for some reason some of the graceful-fs functions aren't complete. For example, I can't seem to copy folders with cp from graceful-fs (cp)

For that one I added cpAsync.


## getLastFolder()

removes everything after the last slash to get folder path

input: /Users/king/Documents/some/folder/xyz
output: xyz

## ðŸ”¹ Path

unlike PathLike, this is only a string

For now, we don't have a clear convention whether or not this string should be absolute or anything.








## getAllFoldersUntilFolder()

NB: I already have this somewhere else but couldn't find it!

If the path is /a/random/path

The result of this function will be:

['/a', '/a/random', '/a/random/path']

Can also be a relative path, but then there will be a slash prepended, so not optimal.

| ---------- | -- | -- |
| folderPath | string |  |

# Tests

<details><summary>Show test information(2)</summary>
    
  # test()

test cases, measure performance:

- big file (1mb) without frontmatter
- big file (1mb) with correct frontmatter
- big file (1mb) with frontmatter with syntax error
- same with small files

TODO:

Implement test

If this works, I can also do many performance improvements for fs-orm, for both read but also for updates. Ideas:

- reading JSON arrays item per item, closing early if a condition is met
- mapping JSON arrays item per item, closing early if a condition is met
- updating/reading kvmd storage
- updating frontmatter
- crud csv

Research more first, thinks like a JSONStream could greatly simplify implementation for this, as well as understanding such code.
