  # translate()

Simple function for translations, that inputs a string (coming from your translation object and a variable object `{[key:string]:string}` that can hold other strings to be inserted. Translate tries to match every key to $keyName, and replaces it by its value.

NB: I purposefully dont create a `t` function like many i18n libraries do, because the type safety is useful, as it can, with a proper doc-comment, show which variables need to be inserted.
