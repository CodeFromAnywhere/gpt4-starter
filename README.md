To get this thing up and running:

1. `git clone https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/gpt4-starter`
2. `cd gpt4-starter`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn dev`
5. go to `os-web` and run `yarn dev` there
6. go to `http://localhost:42001`

To get started with GPT4:

1. create a persona in the database, provide the OpenAI key
2. use the `openai-wrapper` and the `chatCompletion` function to access the chatCompletion API
3. later, once you have access, replace gpt3.5-turbo with gpt4

To get started with whisper (locally):

1. check out the `whisper-local` package
2. you need to install `whisper.cpp` library in `/cloned/whisper.cpp` for now.
