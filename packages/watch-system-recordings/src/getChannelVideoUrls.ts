Should get all video urls, both unlisted and listed ones, from your channel
 
 TODO:
 - fix this
 - get it for CFA and GewoonWijnand
 - download all mp3's for that
 - transcribe all of it, see results
 - figure out how to split speakers locally, that would be amazing. even if not, it's already GREAT.
