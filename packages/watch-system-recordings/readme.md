  # getYoutubeVideoUrls()

Should get all video urls, both unlisted and listed ones, from your channel

TODO:
- fix this
- get it for CFA and GewoonWijnand
- download all mp3's for that
- transcribe all of it, see results
- figure out how to split speakers locally, that would be amazing. even if not, it's already GREAT.
