  # exploreBadNamingFiles()

explore folder recursively, returning an array of filepaths that haven't applied the naming convention.

NB: sometimes the folder has bad names. In that case new folders/files need to be created, recursively.

| absoluteFolderPath | string |  |
| **Output** |    |    |

## watchBadNaming()

Watcher for filenames/folders with capitalisation and spaces, to be renamed to the slugified version. ensure there is no overlap by other watchers.

TODO: the other watchers should ignore files if they have capitals or spaces. Maybe this can be fundamental part of the watcher with a prop like "isPrimary" which means it should be executed first, and a prop like "shouldOmitFromOtherWatchers" which means it will not be included in other watchers if it matches here.

| **Output** | { isSuccessful: boolean, <br />message: string, <br /> }   |    |
