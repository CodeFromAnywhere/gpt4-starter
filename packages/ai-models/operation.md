# ai-models

All modalities in a single "ai-models" package that fuses all wrappers to my preference to abstract away from the provider

- speech --> text (Whisper: locally)
- image --> text (Carrot: banana.dev)
- text --> text (GPT3: ChatGPT, locally)
- text --> speech (?)
- text --> image (Stable Diffusion: banana.dev)

It should be possible to change preferences, primarily useful for going smaller and more local, but keeping it scalable using the big API's
